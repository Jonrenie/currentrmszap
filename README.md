# Current-RMS Zap

Current-RMS is a commercial Rental Management System great for company that rents out equipment.  
Since Current-RMS didn't have a Zap at the time, I decided to make this one!
The "Zap" connects the rental CRM to the awesome Zapier code-free web API automation system.

## Sponsor
Both are apps we use at The Rock Factory (Stage, Sound, Backline, Lighting Hire in Auckland, NZ) https://therockfactory.net/ where I work on this integration for my awesome boss bless her.
